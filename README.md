# ml19k2j-MSc-Project
The project is mainly divided into two parts. The first is the DiskFailure_Predict_DecesionTree. ipynb file, which contains the implementation process of the whole project, from data reading to data processing, to missing value analysis using box plot, and visualization of the frequency distribution of each SMART feature. Finally, the decision tree is used to predict the disk failure and each classification evaluation index.

Another file is DiskFailure_Predict_ThreeModels (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost).ipynb, which records the disk failure prediction results and model effects of three other classification models: Random Forest, Naive Bayes and XGBoost.

Overall, the decision tree in the file shows more information on data analysis and visualization, it is because it is in the early stages of the project implementation, need to fully analysis and comparison of the data, while the other three model file omit the part of the content of the data analysis, mainly to the ultimate failure prediction results and evaluation criteria
